                Hello World! My name is Ciara Gauntt and I have just about completed my certification 
                in full-stack web development through the University of Utah coding bootcamp. Some new 
                updates and exciting news includes an internship with 'Marketing Design Team' where I 
                will be learning about the business behind the development industry and add to my 
                knowledge of UX/UI. I hope you enjoy looking at all the fun things I have built!
                Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns!
